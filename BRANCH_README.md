# Branch: feature/nutrition-tracking

## Purpose
Implement comprehensive nutrition tracking system to complement workout goals with calorie and macro management, enabling complete health ecosystem integration with transparent formula-based calculations.

## Success Criteria
1. **Meal Logging System**: Full CRUD functionality for meals with food database integration and nutrition calculation
2. **Macro Dashboard**: Visual tracking of protein, carbs, fats with daily targets and progress visualization
3. **Goal Integration**: Seamless connection between nutrition data and existing fitness goals (weight loss, muscle gain)
4. **Formula Transparency**: Clear display of calorie calculations and macro distributions with data source attribution
5. **Production Readiness**: TypeScript clean, Supabase integration, full navigation routing, zero compilation errors

## Timeline
- **Day 1**: Database schema design, food database integration, basic meal logging API
- **Day 2**: Frontend meal entry forms, macro calculation engine, dashboard UI components
- **Day 3**: Goal integration, progress visualization, comprehensive testing and TypeScript validation

## Technical Goals
- Supabase nutrition tables with RLS policies (meals, foods, daily_nutrition_summary)
- Food database integration with USDA nutrition data or comprehensive food library
- Real-time macro calculation engine with transparent formulas
- React components for meal logging, food search, and nutrition dashboard
- Integration with existing goal progress calculations (calorie deficits for weight loss)

## User Experience Target
Users can log meals throughout the day, see real-time macro progress, and understand how their nutrition directly impacts their fitness goals through transparent calculations. The system provides actionable insights like "You need 45g more protein to reach today's target" and shows how nutrition choices affect goal timeline predictions.

This addresses the core need: Complete health ecosystem where nutrition and fitness work together with transparent, data-driven progress tracking that eliminates guesswork and provides clear action steps for achieving health goals.

## Dependencies
- ✅ User Goals System (completed - provides integration foundation)
- ✅ Supabase database infrastructure (operational)
- ✅ Real data architecture (established)
- ✅ TypeScript validation workflow (functional)

## Integration Points
- Connect calorie intake with weight loss/gain goal progress calculations
- Link protein intake with strength gain goal recommendations
- Integrate macro balance with body composition goal tracking
- Enhance goal dashboard with nutrition progress indicators

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] **Phase 1**: Database schema and food database (Day 1)
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Meal logging and macro calculation (Day 2) 
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Goal integration and production deployment (Day 3)

**Branch Status**: Ready for task generation and development planning
