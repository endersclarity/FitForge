- [ ] **React Router Integration** - Complete routing configuration for all intended page destinations
- [ ] **Workout Logic Integration** - Connect frontend components to backend workout calculation formulas
- [ ] **API Endpoint Connection** - Establish data flow between frontend workout components and server APIs
- [ ] **User Interface Responsiveness** - Ensure all buttons provide immediate visual feedback and proper navigation
- [ ] **Contextual Workout Calculations** - Implement formulas and logic relevant to workout tracking context
- [ ] **Data Persistence Validation** - Verify workout data is properly saved and retrieved through user interactions
- [ ] **Testing Suite Implementation** - Create comprehensive tests for button functionality and navigation flows
- [ ] **Performance Optimization** - Ensure button interactions and page transitions are smooth and responsive
