# Branch: Auto-Populate Body Weight for Bodyweight Exercises

**Issue**: [#26 Auto-Populate Body Weight for Bodyweight Exercises](https://github.com/endersclarity/FitForge/issues/26)  
**Branch**: `feature/auto-populate-body-weight-issue-26`  
**Created**: 2025-06-03  
**Type**: Enhancement - User Experience & Data Foundation

## üéØ Success Criteria ‚úÖ ALL COMPLETED

### Core Functionality
- [x] **Detect bodyweight exercises** from exercise database via `/api/exercises/is-bodyweight/{exerciseId}`
- [x] **Auto-populate weight field** with user's body weight from profile
- [x] **Display clear weight indication** showing "200 lbs (body weight)" format with badges
- [x] **Provide additional weight option** for dumbbells, weighted vest, weight belt, backpack
- [x] **Calculate total weight accurately** as `bodyWeight + additionalWeight`
- [x] **Handle missing body weight** by prompting user for profile completion
- [x] **Save additional weight preferences** per exercise for future sessions

### Data Infrastructure 
- [x] **User profile system** for storing body weight and preferences via `useUserProfile()`
- [x] **Profile completion workflow** when body weight is missing via `ProfileSetupDialog`
- [x] **Integration with existing volume calculations** (weight √ó reps √ó sets)
- [x] **Data persistence** across sessions and page refreshes

### User Experience
- [x] **Seamless workflow integration** with existing workout logging in `SetLogger.tsx`
- [x] **Clear visual distinction** between body weight and additional weight with visual indicators
- [x] **Progressive enhancement** - works without breaking existing functionality
- [x] **Responsive design** across mobile and desktop interfaces

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: User Profile Foundation (Days 1-2)
```typescript
// Core data structures and storage
interface UserProfile {
  bodyWeight: number;
  heightFeet: number;
  heightInches: number;
  age: number;
  goals: {
    calorieTarget?: number;
    volumeIncreasePreference: number; // percentage
  };
}
```

**Tasks:**
- Create user profile schema and TypeScript interfaces
- Build profile storage system (JSON file-based for development)
- Design profile completion/editing UI components
- Implement profile data hooks and context providers

### Phase 2: Exercise Detection & Auto-Population (Days 3-4)
```typescript
// Exercise classification and weight logic
interface BodyweightExerciseConfig {
  baseWeight: number;
  additionalWeight: number;
  totalWeight: number;
  additionalEquipment?: string;
}
```

**Tasks:**
- Enhance exercise database queries to detect bodyweight exercises
- Modify SetLogger component to auto-populate weight for bodyweight exercises
- Add additional weight input UI with equipment selection
- Update volume calculation logic to use total weight

### Phase 3: Integration & Polish (Days 5-6)
**Tasks:**
- Integrate profile completion prompts into workout flow
- Add preference persistence for additional weights per exercise
- Implement data migration for existing users
- Add comprehensive error handling and edge cases
- Mobile responsiveness and UX polish

## üß™ Testing Strategy ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Unit Testing
- [x] User profile data validation and storage
- [x] Exercise type detection algorithms via API integration
- [x] Weight calculation logic (bodyweight + additional)
- [x] Volume calculation accuracy with enhanced breakdowns

### Integration Testing
- [x] Profile completion workflow end-to-end
- [x] Workout logging with auto-populated weights
- [x] Data persistence across browser sessions
- [x] Migration compatibility with existing workout data

### User Experience Testing
- [x] First-time user onboarding flow via `ProfileSetupDialog`
- [x] Existing user profile setup and body weight management
- [x] Bodyweight vs weighted exercise workflows
- [x] Mobile device compatibility with touch-optimized controls

## üìä Foundation for Future Features

This implementation creates the **user data infrastructure** that enables:

- **Progressive Overload Algorithm** (Issue #23) - needs user weight and preferences
- **Chart.js Progress Dashboard** (Issue #13) - needs user metrics for context
- **Recovery Tracking** (Issue #24) - needs user body composition data
- **Smart Exercise Selection** (Issue #11) - needs user equipment and preferences

## üéõÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
User Profile ‚Üí Exercise Detection ‚Üí Weight Auto-Population ‚Üí Volume Calculation ‚Üí Progress Tracking
```

### Key Components
- `useUserProfile()` - Profile data management hook
- `ProfileSetupDialog` - Profile completion UI
- `EnhancedSetLogger` - Modified workout logging with auto-population
- `BodyweightExerciseService` - Exercise classification and weight logic

### Integration Points
- Exercise database (`universal-exercise-database.json`)
- Workout session management (`use-workout-session.tsx`)
- User data storage (file-based system)
- Volume calculation services

## üöÄ Estimated Timeline

**Total Duration**: 6 days
- **Days 1-2**: User profile foundation and data structures
- **Days 3-4**: Exercise detection and auto-population logic  
- **Days 5-6**: Integration, testing, and polish

**Daily Commitment**: 4-6 hours focused development
**Complexity**: Medium (new data infrastructure + UI integration)
