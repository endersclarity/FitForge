# Branch: feature/digital-ocean-deployment

## Purpose
Deploy FitForge fitness ecosystem to Digital Ocean App Platform using the FREE tier for $0/month hosting with Supabase backend integration. Achieve production deployment with automated CI/CD, monitoring, and scalability.

## Success Criteria
1. **Free Tier Deployment**: Successfully deploy on Digital Ocean static site hosting ($0/month)
2. **Supabase Integration**: Verify database connectivity and real-time features work in production
3. **Build Pipeline**: Automated builds from GitHub with TypeScript validation and error-free deployment
4. **Production Testing**: Complete user workflows functional (registration, workout logging, goal tracking)
5. **Domain & SSL**: Custom domain with automatic SSL certificates and proper routing
6. **Monitoring Setup**: Health checks, error tracking, and performance monitoring configured

## Timeline
- **Day 1**: MCP setup verification, GitHub push, initial deployment configuration and testing
- **Day 2**: Production deployment execution, domain setup, SSL configuration, basic monitoring
- **Day 3**: Comprehensive testing, performance optimization, monitoring setup, documentation

## Technical Goals
- Digital Ocean App Platform static site configuration with free tier
- GitHub repository integration with automatic deployments on main branch push
- Supabase environment variables properly configured for production
- Build process optimized: npm ci && npm run build && npm run check
- SPA routing with catchall_document for React Router
- Production environment testing with real user workflows

## User Experience Target
Users can access FitForge at a production URL (fitforge-app.com or similar), register accounts, log workouts, set goals, and track progress with the same functionality as development but with production-grade performance, reliability, and security.

This addresses the core need: Moving from development to production with zero-cost hosting while maintaining full functionality and establishing foundation for scaling as user base grows.

## Dependencies
- âœ… Digital Ocean App Platform account (free tier available)
- âœ… GitHub repository with FitForge codebase (configured)
- âœ… Supabase database and authentication (operational)
- âœ… Free tier deployment configuration (.do/app.yaml updated)
- ðŸ”§ Digital Ocean MCP server access (needs configuration)

## Integration Points
- Connect GitHub repository to Digital Ocean App Platform for CI/CD
- Configure Supabase environment variables for production environment
- Set up domain routing and SSL certificate management
- Integrate monitoring and error tracking for production operations
- Establish deployment workflow for future feature releases

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] **Phase 1**: MCP access verification and GitHub deployment setup (Day 1)
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Production deployment and domain configuration (Day 2)
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Testing, monitoring, and documentation (Day 3)

**Branch Status**: Ready for MCP verification and deployment planning
