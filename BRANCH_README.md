# Branch: feature/issue-7-real-data-architecture

## Purpose
Replace the fake data generation system with real user workout logging functionality to enable meaningful progress tracking and provide actual value to users.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Remove all fake workout session generation code
- [ ] Implement real workout logging API endpoints with persistent storage
- [ ] Create user-specific data files (JSON/CSV) for workout history
- [ ] Enable users to log actual sets, reps, and weights during workouts
- [ ] Update progress analytics to consume real logged data
- [ ] Verify all progress metrics calculate from actual user input
- [ ] Ensure data persists between sessions
- [ ] Add data migration for existing users (if any)

## Scope & Deliverables

### Phase 1: Foundation (Audit & Design)
- Comprehensive audit of fake data generation components
- Design real workout session data models
- Create API endpoint specifications
- Define user data file structure

### Phase 2: Implementation
- Build workout logging API endpoints:
  - POST /api/workouts/start - Start new workout session
  - POST /api/workouts/:id/sets - Log individual sets
  - PUT /api/workouts/:id/complete - Complete workout session
  - GET /api/workouts/history - Retrieve user workout history
- Implement user-specific data persistence
- Replace fake data components with real input forms
- Add workout session state management

### Phase 3: Integration & Cleanup
- Update progress analytics to use real data
- Remove all fake data generation code
- Verify metrics calculations with real data
- Add data validation and error handling

## Dependencies
- Completed: Phase 4 (Button functionality)
- Completed: Issue #4 (Export functionality)
- Partial: Issue #5 (Progress metrics - formulas ready, needs real data)

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all new API endpoints
- Integration tests for workout logging flow
- Data persistence verification
- Progress calculation accuracy tests
- Manual testing checklist:
  - [ ] User can start a workout
  - [ ] User can log sets with weights/reps
  - [ ] Data persists after server restart
  - [ ] Progress metrics update with real data
  - [ ] Export includes real workout history

## Merge Criteria
- All success criteria met
- Test suite passing (when implemented)
- No regression in existing functionality
- Code review approved
- Documentation updated
- Fake data generation completely removed

## Timeline
- Estimated duration: 2-3 days
- Phase 1: 2-4 hours (audit and design)
- Phase 2: 1-2 days (implementation)
- Phase 3: 4-6 hours (integration and cleanup)

## Key Milestones
1. **Day 1**: Complete audit and API design
2. **Day 2**: Implement core logging endpoints and persistence
3. **Day 3**: Integration, cleanup, and testing

## Technical Approach

### Data Storage
- User-specific JSON files in `data/users/{userId}/workouts.json`
- Structured format for easy parsing and extension
- Backup strategy with dated archives

### API Design
```typescript
// Start workout
POST /api/workouts/start
Body: { userId: string, exercises: Exercise[] }
Response: { workoutId: string, startTime: Date }

// Log set
POST /api/workouts/:id/sets
Body: { exerciseId: string, setNumber: number, weight: number, reps: number }
Response: { success: boolean, totalVolume: number }

// Complete workout
PUT /api/workouts/:id/complete
Body: { endTime: Date }
Response: { summary: WorkoutSummary }
```

### Migration Strategy
1. Detect existing fake data
2. Archive fake data separately
3. Start fresh with real user logging
4. Provide clear user communication

## Impact
This branch addresses the **#1 critical issue** preventing FitForge from delivering real value. Once complete:
- Users can track actual progress
- Metrics become meaningful
- App transforms from demo to functional tool
- Unblocks Phase 5 and other enhancements

## Notes
- Issue #7 created after discovering app generates 96 fake workout sessions
- All current "progress" is simulated, not real user achievements
- This is the foundation for making FitForge a genuine fitness tracking tool
