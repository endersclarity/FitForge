# Branch: fix/production-deployment-broken

## Critical Issue
FitForge production deployment at https://fitforge-free-9zezd.ondigitalocean.app shows only a blank white page, indicating complete application failure in production environment.

## Purpose
Diagnose and fix the production deployment to restore at least the same functionality that worked in local development. This is a critical bug that makes the application completely unusable in production.

## Success Criteria
1. **Application Loads**: Production URL shows the FitForge application interface, not a blank page
2. **Core Functionality**: At minimum, homepage, navigation, and basic user flows work
3. **Console Clean**: No critical JavaScript errors preventing app initialization
4. **Build Process**: Vite production build completes without breaking the app
5. **Environment Variables**: Supabase and other required env vars properly configured
6. **Routing Works**: React Router handles navigation without 404s or blank pages

## Root Cause Investigation Plan
1. **Console Errors**: Check browser dev tools for JavaScript errors
2. **Build Output**: Verify production build artifacts are valid
3. **Environment Variables**: Confirm all required vars are set in Digital Ocean
4. **Vite Configuration**: Check if vite.config.ts is production-ready
5. **Import Paths**: Verify all imports resolve correctly in production
6. **Static Assets**: Ensure assets are served correctly from production build

## Timeline
- **Immediate**: Diagnose root cause through browser inspection and logs
- **Hour 1**: Fix critical build/configuration issues
- **Hour 2**: Test and verify working deployment
- **Hour 3**: Document fix and ensure reproducible solution

## Technical Debugging Steps
1. Inspect https://fitforge-free-9zezd.ondigitalocean.app in browser dev tools
2. Check Digital Ocean deployment logs for build errors
3. Compare local development vs production build outputs
4. Verify environment variable configuration in Digital Ocean
5. Test production build locally: `npm run build && npm run preview`
6. Fix identified issues and redeploy

## User Experience Target
Users visiting the production URL should see the same FitForge application they would see in development - homepage with navigation, ability to register/login, and access to workout features.

## Critical Priority
This is a **production-breaking bug** that must be fixed immediately. The application is completely non-functional for end users.

## Dependencies
- ✅ Digital Ocean deployment infrastructure (working)
- ✅ GitHub CI/CD pipeline (working)
- ❌ Application actually loading and running (BROKEN)
- ❌ Environment variables properly configured (unknown)
- ❌ Production build configuration (unknown)

## Integration Points
- Fix Vite production build configuration for React SPA
- Ensure Digital Ocean environment variables match development needs
- Verify static asset serving and routing configuration
- Test Supabase connectivity in production environment

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] **Phase 1**: Root cause diagnosis (browser inspection, logs analysis)
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Fix critical build/config issues
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Verify working deployment and test core functionality

**Branch Status**: Critical production bug - application completely non-functional
