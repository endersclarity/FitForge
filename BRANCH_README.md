# Branch: feature/ux-critical-fixes

## 🎯 Branch Objective
Fix critical UX issues identified in comprehensive audit that prevent core user features from functioning properly.

## 🚨 Critical Problem Statement
**Current Issue**: Comprehensive UX audit revealed **4 critical issues** that completely break key user experiences:
- **Goals API Missing**: Goal creation and management completely non-functional
- **Progress Analytics API Missing**: Progress tracking and data visualization broken  
- **Poor Error Handling**: HTML 404s instead of JSON errors confuse users and break frontend
- **Session Management**: Active workout conflicts prevent users from starting new workouts

**User Impact**: Users can log workouts but cannot set goals, view progress analytics, or easily manage workout sessions

## ✅ Success Criteria
This branch is complete when:
1. **Goals System Functional**: Users can create, manage, and track goals with full backend API support
2. **Progress Analytics Working**: Complete progress tracking with charts, analytics, and data visualization
3. **Proper Error Handling**: All API endpoints return consistent JSON error responses with helpful messages
4. **Smooth Session Management**: Users can easily start workouts without session conflicts
5. **All UX Issues Resolved**: Zero critical or major issues remaining from comprehensive audit
