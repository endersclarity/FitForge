## üîß TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### Database Schema Design
```typescript
// Enhanced Workout Session
interface WorkoutSession {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  workoutType: string;
  startTime: Date;
  endTime?: Date;
  status: 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'paused';
  exercises: ExerciseLog[];
  totalVolume: number;
  duration?: number;
  notes?: string;
}

// Exercise Performance Log
interface ExerciseLog {
  exerciseId: string;
  exerciseName: string;
  sets: SetLog[];
  targetSets: number;
  targetReps: number;
  targetWeight: number;
  formScore?: number;
  notes?: string;
}

// Individual Set Logging
interface SetLog {
  setNumber: number;
  weight: number;
  reps: number;
  completed: boolean;
  restTimeSeconds?: number;
  rpe?: number; // Rate of Perceived Exertion
  notes?: string;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

### API Endpoint Specifications
```typescript
// Start workout session
POST /api/workout-sessions/start
Body: { workoutType: string, exerciseIds: string[] }
Response: { sessionId: string, exercises: ExerciseTemplate[] }

// Log individual set
PATCH /api/workout-sessions/:sessionId/exercises/:exerciseId/sets/:setNumber
Body: { weight: number, reps: number, completed: boolean }
Response: { success: boolean, progressUpdate: object }

// Complete workout
POST /api/workout-sessions/:sessionId/complete
Body: { rating?: number, notes?: string }
Response: { session: WorkoutSession, summary: WorkoutSummary }
```

### Frontend State Management
```typescript
// Workout session hook
const useWorkoutSession = (sessionId: string) => {
  const [session, setSession] = useState<WorkoutSession>();
  const [currentExercise, setCurrentExercise] = useState<number>(0);
  
  const logSet = async (exerciseId: string, setData: SetLog) => {
    // API call + optimistic update
  };
  
  const completeWorkout = async (notes?: string) => {
    // Save final session data
  };
  
  return { session, currentExercise, logSet, completeWorkout };
};
```

## üö® CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### No Mock Data Policy
- **MANDATORY**: Remove all fake/mock workout data from the application
- **MANDATORY**: Every progress metric must be calculated from real user input
- **MANDATORY**: Show clear "No data" states when users haven't logged workouts
- **MANDATORY**: Display data source formulas transparently

### Data Architecture Compliance
- **MANDATORY**: Follow `memory-bank/system_manifest_data_driven.md` architecture
- **MANDATORY**: Use existing Universal Exercise Database from `data/exercises/`
- **MANDATORY**: Store user data in structured JSON files under `data/users/{userId}/`
- **MANDATORY**: Implement proper Zod schema validation for all user input

### Real User Experience
- **MANDATORY**: Test with actual workout logging scenarios
- **MANDATORY**: Handle missing data gracefully with clear user guidance
- **MANDATORY**: Show progress calculations with transparent formulas
- **MANDATORY**: Enable users to see their workout history and improvements

## üß™ TESTING SCENARIOS

### End-to-End User Flow
1. New user visits workouts page
2. Selects "Chest & Triceps" workout
3. Reviews auto-selected exercises and adjusts weights
4. Starts workout session
5. Logs 3 sets of each exercise with actual weight/reps
6. Completes workout with rating and notes
7. Views workout summary with logged data
8. Checks progress page to see new data in charts

### Data Validation Scenarios
1. Invalid weight/reps input handling
2. Session state persistence across page refreshes
3. Multiple concurrent workout sessions (error handling)
4. Workout completion without logging all sets
5. Historical data accuracy and calculation verification

### Edge Cases
1. User starts workout but doesn't complete it
2. Network connectivity issues during logging
3. Large workout sessions with 10+ exercises
4. Users with no previous workout history
5. Exercise database integration with missing exercises

## üîó BRANCH DEPENDENCIES

### Existing Assets
- ‚úÖ Universal Exercise Database (38 exercises with muscle percentages)
- ‚úÖ Basic workout session schema in `shared/schema.ts`
- ‚úÖ File-based storage system in `server/fileStorage.ts`
- ‚úÖ Exercise API endpoints in `server/routes/exercises.ts`
- ‚úÖ Frontend components in `client/src/components/ui/`

### Integration Points
- **Exercise Database**: Use existing Universal Exercise Database
- **User Authentication**: Leverage existing auth system (user ID 1 for testing)
- **File Storage**: Extend existing JSON file storage for workout sessions
- **Progress Charts**: Connect to existing chart components in progress page
- **Navigation**: Use existing routing system with proper state management

## üìù NOTES

### Development Environment
- WSL IP Address: Use for Windows browser testing
- Port 5000: Unified development server (backend + frontend)
- Real Data Only: No mock data policy strictly enforced
- Database First: Design data schema before implementing UI

### Implementation Strategy
1. Start with backend database schema and API endpoints
2. Build minimal frontend components for data entry
3. Test with real user data scenarios immediately
4. Iterate based on actual user workflow testing
5. Polish UX after core functionality is proven

### Risk Mitigation
- Backup existing data before schema changes
- Implement data validation at API level
- Test database operations thoroughly
- Monitor performance with large datasets
- Plan rollback strategy if issues arise
