# Branch: feature/complete-supabase-integration

## Purpose
Complete the Supabase integration by setting up database schema, authentication system, and migrating from local file storage to production-ready cloud infrastructure.

## Success Criteria
1. **Database Schema**: Full Supabase database with tables for users, workouts, exercises, and sets
2. **Authentication System**: Working user registration and login with Supabase Auth
3. **Data Migration**: All existing workout data migrated from JSON files to Supabase
4. **Real-time Features**: Live workout session updates and progress tracking
5. **Production Readiness**: Complete environment setup ready for Digital Ocean deployment

## Timeline
