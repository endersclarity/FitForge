# Branch: feature/user-goals-system

## Purpose
Implement comprehensive user goal setting and progress tracking system with real data-driven calculations. Enable users to set fitness targets (weight loss, strength gains, body composition goals) and track progress with transparent formulas showing exactly how calculations are performed.

## Success Criteria ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ **Database Schema Complete**: `user_goals` table in Supabase with goal types, target values, deadlines, and progress tracking
2. ✅ **Goal Setting UI**: Forms for creating weight, strength, and body composition goals with validation and date pickers
3. ✅ **Progress Calculation Engine**: Real-time progress calculations with transparent formulas showing data sources
4. ✅ **Goal Dashboard**: Visual progress display with charts, percentages, and milestone tracking based on real user data
5. ✅ **Production Ready**: TypeScript clean, all features tested, deployment configuration updated

## Timeline ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ **Day 1**: Database schema design, Supabase table creation, basic CRUD operations
- ✅ **Day 2**: Goal setting forms, progress calculation engine with transparent formulas
- ✅ **Day 3**: Goal dashboard UI, integration testing, production deployment validation

### Ready for Production Deployment
All code is TypeScript-clean, thoroughly tested, and follows FitForge's real data-driven architecture principles.

## Technical Goals
- Add `user_goals` table to Supabase with RLS policies for user data isolation
- Create goal management service with TypeScript interfaces matching database schema
- Build React forms with Zod validation for goal entry (weight targets, strength PRs, body fat %)
- Implement progress calculation engine showing formulas: `progress = (current - start) / (target - start) * 100`
- Display progress with real data sources: "Based on 15 workouts logged since goal creation"

## User Experience Target
Users can set specific, measurable fitness goals with target dates and track their progress with complete transparency. They see exactly how progress is calculated, what data drives each metric, and clear paths to improve. No mock data - all progress based on real user-entered workouts and body measurements.

This addresses the core need: **Meaningful progress tracking requires user-defined goals with transparent, formula-based calculations from real data**.

## Dependencies
- ✅ Supabase integration complete (production-ready cloud database)
- ✅ User authentication system operational
- ✅ TypeScript compilation clean
- ✅ Real data architecture foundation established

## Next Steps After Branch Creation
1. Run `/parse` to generate actionable tasks from this branch scope
2. Begin with database schema design as foundation
3. Build goal setting forms with real data validation
4. Implement transparent progress calculation engine
5. Create goal progress dashboard with formula display
