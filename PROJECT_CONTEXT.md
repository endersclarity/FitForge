## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**What is FitForge?**
FitForge is a real data-driven fitness ecosystem that helps users track workouts, set goals, and make progress. The core philosophy is **NO MOCK DATA** - everything must be driven by actual user input.

**Current Status:**
- Working React frontend with TypeScript
- Node.js backend with JSON file storage
- Real user data entry and workout tracking
- Multiple pain points in UX and data flow

**Why Parallel Development?**
We're using 4 agents working simultaneously on different aspects to accelerate development while preventing file conflicts through strict domain boundaries.

## 2. ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Radix UI
- Backend: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- Storage: JSON files (no database yet)
- Build: Vite for frontend, tsx for backend
- Deployment: Single port 5000 for unified dev experience

**Key Directories:**
```
FitForge/
├── client/src/           # React frontend
│   ├── components/       # UI components
│   ├── pages/           # Route components  
│   ├── services/        # Data access layer

## 4. KNOWN ISSUES & PAIN POINTS

**🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES:**
1. **Goal Validation UX** - Users confused about goal setup flow
2. **Mobile Responsiveness** - Poor touch interaction on mobile devices
3. **Workout Session Conflicts** - Multiple sessions can run simultaneously
4. **Data Inconsistency** - Some services use different data formats
5. **Error Handling** - Poor feedback when operations fail

**🔍 SPECIFIC PROBLEMS:**
- Goal wizard doesn't validate required fields properly
- Touch targets too small on mobile (buttons < 44px)
- Notification system exists but isn't properly integrated
- Progress charts sometimes show empty data
- Exercise selection can be overwhelming for new users

---

## 5. PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY

**Why 4 Agents?**
Each agent owns a specific domain to prevent file conflicts while accelerating development.

**Coordination Rules:**
- Agents MUST check their boundaries before touching any file
- Conflicts require immediate escalation to operator
- Frequent commits to feature branches (agent-ui-components, agent-new-pages, etc.)
- NO direct merges to master without operator approval

**Communication Protocol:**
All agents read this PROJECT_CONTEXT.md file before starting work to understand the full project scope and their role within it.

## 6. AGENT-SPECIFIC CONTEXTS

### 6.1 AGENT A - UI COMPONENTS & MOBILE

**YOUR MISSION:**
Improve mobile responsiveness and core UI component usability.

**YOUR DOMAIN:**
- `client/src/components/ui/` - Button, Input, Card, Dialog components
- `client/src/components/mobile-*` - Mobile-specific components
- `client/src/hooks/use-mobile*` - Mobile interaction hooks
- `client/src/index.css` - Global styles and mobile responsiveness

**CURRENT PAIN POINTS YOU SOLVE:**
1. **Button Touch Targets:** Many buttons < 44px minimum touch target
2. **Mobile Navigation:** Hard to use on small screens
3. **Form Inputs:** Poor mobile keyboard handling
4. **Dialog/Modal UX:** Don't work well on mobile

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- All interactive elements ≥ 44px touch targets
- Smooth touch interactions (no 300ms delay)
- Proper mobile keyboard handling
- Responsive design works 320px to 1920px widths

**EXAMPLE TASK:**
Audit all Button components in `client/src/components/ui/button.tsx` and ensure minimum 44px touch targets. Test on mobile device or browser dev tools.

### 6.2 AGENT B - NEW PAGES & GOAL SYSTEM

**YOUR MISSION:**
Improve goal-setting user experience and create new user-friendly pages.

**YOUR DOMAIN:**
- `client/src/pages/goals/` - Goal-related pages
- `client/src/pages/exercise-library.tsx` - Exercise selection experience
- `client/src/components/goals/` - Goal-specific components
- Goal wizard and validation flows

**CURRENT PAIN POINTS YOU SOLVE:**
1. **Goal Setup Confusion:** Users don't understand how to set effective goals
2. **Exercise Library Overwhelm:** 1000+ exercises with poor filtering
3. **Goal Progress Unclear:** Hard to see if users are on track
4. **New User Onboarding:** No clear path for first-time users

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- Clear goal wizard with validation and helpful hints
- Exercise library with smart filtering and search
- Goal progress clearly visible with actionable next steps
- Smooth onboarding flow for new users

**EXAMPLE TASK:**
Improve the goal wizard in `client/src/pages/goals/new-goal.tsx` by adding field validation, progress indicators, and helpful examples of good vs bad goals.

### 6.3 AGENT C - SERVICES & ANALYTICS

**YOUR MISSION:**
Enhance data services and create better analytics for user progress tracking.

**YOUR DOMAIN:**
- `client/src/services/` - All service files
- `client/src/hooks/use-*` - Data-related hooks only
- Analytics calculations and data processing
- Performance optimization

**CURRENT PAIN POINTS YOU SOLVE:**
1. **Data Inconsistency:** Services use different data formats
2. **Slow Performance:** Some operations take too long
3. **Missing Analytics:** Users want better progress insights
4. **Service Integration:** Services don't work well together

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- Consistent data formats across all services
- Fast performance (< 100ms for most operations)
- Rich analytics showing meaningful progress trends
- Clean service APIs that other components can easily use

**EXAMPLE TASK:**
Audit `client/src/services/local-workout-service.ts` and ensure it follows the same TypeScript interfaces as other services. Add performance monitoring and optimize slow operations.

### 6.4 AGENT D - API & BACKEND

**YOUR MISSION:**
Enhance backend API, improve data persistence, and build notification system.

**YOUR DOMAIN:**
- `server/` - All backend files
- API routes and middleware
- Data storage and retrieval
- `shared/` schemas (with coordination)

**CURRENT PAIN POINTS YOU SOLVE:**
1. **API Inconsistency:** Endpoints don't follow RESTful patterns
2. **Notification System:** Exists but not properly integrated
3. **Data Validation:** Poor server-side validation
4. **Error Handling:** API errors don't provide helpful feedback

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- RESTful API with consistent response formats
- Working notification system for workouts and goals
- Robust server-side validation with clear error messages
- Efficient data storage and retrieval

**EXAMPLE TASK:**
Review `server/routes.ts` and implement a proper notification service that can send workout reminders and goal milestone celebrations. Integrate with existing frontend notification components.

## 7. CODE PATTERNS & STANDARDS

**TypeScript Requirements:**
- NO `any` types allowed
- All functions must have proper type annotations
- Use Zod schemas for data validation

**React Patterns:**
- Functional components with hooks only
- Custom hooks for data access (`use-workout-session.tsx`)
- Error boundaries for robustness

**API Patterns:**
```typescript
// Good API response format
{
  success: true,
  data: {...},
  message: "Operation completed"
}

// Error response format  
{
  success: false,
  error: "Specific error message",
  code: "ERROR_CODE"
}
```

**File Organization:**
- Components grouped by feature, not type
- Services handle all data access
- Shared schemas in `shared/` directory
- No business logic in UI components

---

## 8. SUCCESS CRITERIA

**For Each Agent:**
- Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- All new features tested on mobile and desktop
- Code follows established patterns
- Documentation updated for new features
- Commits include clear, descriptive messages

**For Project Overall:**
- Improved user experience based on known pain points
- Better mobile responsiveness 
- More robust data handling
- Clear path for new users to get started
