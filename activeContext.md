**Current Branch**: master  
**Last Updated**: 2025-06-03  
**Status**: âœ… Issue #26 COMPLETE - Auto-populate body weight feature successfully implemented and merged

## Session Overview  
ðŸŽ‰ **FEATURE COMPLETE**: Auto-Populate Body Weight for Bodyweight Exercises (GitHub Issue #26)
- âœ… **Implementation Complete**: Full bodyweight auto-population system implemented
- âœ… **PR #30 Merged**: Feature successfully merged to master via comprehensive review process  
- âœ… **codeRABBIT Review Passed**: All code quality issues resolved (isFinite â†’ Number.isFinite, parseInt radix)
- âœ… **Production Ready**: Feature deployed and available for users

## Current Development Phase
**Phase**: Post-Implementation - Feature Complete  
**Status**: Issue #26 fully resolved and deployed to production  
**Priority**: Available for next development initiative

## Completed Implementation (GitHub Issue #26)
**Goal**: âœ… Automatically populate user's body weight for bodyweight exercises
**Foundation**: âœ… User profile system implemented and operational

**Implemented Features**:
1. âœ… **Auto-detect bodyweight exercises** - API-based detection via `/api/exercises/is-bodyweight/{exerciseId}`
2. âœ… **Auto-populate weight field** - User's body weight automatically filled for bodyweight exercises
3. âœ… **Additional weight support** - Dumbbells, weighted vest, weight belt, backpack options
4. âœ… **Accurate volume calculations** - Total weight (bodyweight + additional) included in all metrics
5. âœ… **User profile infrastructure** - Complete ProfileSetupDialog and body stats management
6. âœ… **Preference persistence** - Additional weight preferences saved per exercise
7. âœ… **Missing data handling** - Profile completion prompts during workout flow

## Available Next Steps
**Development Options**:
1. **New GitHub Issue**: Implement next priority feature from backlog
2. **Code Quality**: Additional TypeScript improvements or performance optimization
3. **User Experience**: Enhanced mobile responsiveness or accessibility features
4. **Testing Coverage**: Expand unit test coverage for bodyweight auto-population

## Technical Architecture Status
- **User Profile System**: âœ… Complete with body weight storage and ProfileSetupDialog
- **Exercise Database**: âœ… Universal exercise database with bodyweight detection API
- **SetLogger Component**: âœ… Enhanced with comprehensive bodyweight auto-population
- **Volume Calculations**: âœ… Updated to include bodyweight in all progress metrics

## Available Commands
- `/init` - AI agent integration setup
- `/branch` - Development branch creation  
- `/task` - Intelligent task execution
- `/sync` - Project state synchronization
- `/web-eval` - Application testing and evaluation
- `/dev` - Start development server
- `/test` - TypeScript validation and testing

## Implementation Timeline (Completed)
- âœ… **Days 1-2**: Foundation - User profile infrastructure & exercise database enhancement
- âœ… **Days 3-4**: Core Logic - SetLogger enhancement & additional weight system  
- âœ… **Days 5-6**: Integration - Volume calculations & missing data handling
- âœ… **Day 7**: Polish & Testing - UX refinement & quality assurance

## Foundation Value Delivered
This feature successfully established the **user profile system** - critical infrastructure now enabling:
- âœ… Body composition tracking
- âœ… Goal-based recommendations  
- âœ… Personalized workout analytics
- âœ… Progressive overload calculations
- âœ… Other features requiring user data

**Achievement**: Sustainable user data collection patterns implemented through bodyweight exercise auto-population
