# Active Context - FitForge Project

**Current Branch**: master  
**Last Updated**: 2025-06-04T12:00:00Z  
**Status**: ✅ REAL DATA INTEGRATION COMPLETE - User Intake System OPERATIONAL

## Session Overview  
🎯 **CRITICAL MILESTONE ACHIEVED**: Complete Real Data Integration with Functional User Intake
- ✅ **Intake Form Success**: 3-step user profile collection form fully operational
- ✅ **Mock Data Eliminated**: Dashboard and progress pages now use real user preferences
- ✅ **Form Submission Fixed**: Critical validation issue resolved with proper data merging
- ✅ **User Experience Complete**: Full onboarding flow from intake to dashboard functional
- ✅ **Data Architecture Solid**: Real user data flows throughout entire application
- ✅ **Stagewise Disabled**: Click interception removed to allow normal form interaction

## Current Development Phase
**Phase**: Real Data Foundation Complete - User Onboarding Operational  
**Status**: Complete transition from mock data prototype to functional real-data application  
**Priority**: User can now input profile data and see real metrics throughout FitForge

## Major Implementation: Real Data Integration & User Intake System
**Problem Solved**: ⚠️ "FitForge was showing mock data throughout the app instead of real user data"
**Foundation**: 🎯 Complete real user data architecture with functional intake system

**Critical Systems Implemented**:
1. ✅ **User Intake Form** - 3-step profile collection (body stats, target goals, workout preferences)
2. ✅ **Real Data Integration** - Dashboard and progress pages connected to actual user preferences
3. ✅ **Data Validation Fixed** - Form submission issue resolved with proper UserPreferences schema compliance
4. ✅ **Service Layer Architecture** - UserPreferencesService for API communication and data management
5. ✅ **Complete Onboarding Flow** - Intake → Dashboard redirect with real data persistence
6. ✅ **Mock Data Elimination** - All placeholder data replaced with real user input
7. ✅ **User Experience Optimization** - Stagewise disabled for normal form interaction

## Previously Completed (GitHub Issue #26)
**Goal**: ✅ Auto-populate body weight for bodyweight exercises  
**Status**: Production ready and operational

## Available Next Steps
**High-Priority Development Options** (Real Data Foundation Complete - Ready for Advanced Features):
1. **Goal System Integration** - Connect user target goals to progress tracking and recommendations
2. **Workout History Enhancement** - Expand workout logging with real user preference integration
3. **Exercise Progression Analysis** - Individual exercise trend charts using real user data
4. **Advanced Analytics Engine** - Weekly/monthly trend analysis with user preference insights
5. **AI-Powered Recommendations** - Smart workout suggestions based on user profile and goals
6. **Body Composition Tracking** - Enhanced body stats monitoring with goal comparison
7. **Mobile Optimization** - Responsive design for intake forms and data displays
8. **Social Features** - Progress sharing using real user achievements and metrics
