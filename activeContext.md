# Active Context - FitForge Project

**Current Branch**: feature/auto-populate-bodyweight-issue-26  
**Last Updated**: 2025-06-03  
**Status**: New feature branch created - ready to start implementation

## Session Overview  
ðŸŽ¯ **NEW FEATURE BRANCH**: Auto-Populate Body Weight for Bodyweight Exercises (GitHub Issue #26)
- âœ… **Branch Created**: `feature/auto-populate-bodyweight-issue-26`
- âœ… **BRANCH_README.md**: Comprehensive implementation plan with success criteria
- âœ… **Context Updated**: Project focus shifted to foundation user data collection
- ðŸš€ **Ready to Start**: Phase 1 implementation can begin immediately

## Current Development Phase
**Phase**: Foundation User Data Infrastructure  
**Status**: New feature branch ready for implementation  
**Priority**: Medium - Build user profile system for bodyweight exercise auto-population

## Implementation Focus (GitHub Issue #26)
**Goal**: Automatically populate user's body weight for bodyweight exercises
**Foundation**: User profile system for data collection across FitForge
**Key Features**:
1. Auto-detect bodyweight exercises from exercise database
2. Auto-populate weight field with user's current body weight  
3. Support additional weight (dumbbells, weighted vest) on top of body weight
4. Accurate volume calculations including body weight
5. User profile infrastructure for future features requiring user data

## Next Steps Ready
**Available Actions**:
1. **Begin Phase 1**: Set up user profile body weight infrastructure
2. **Test Exercise Database**: Verify bodyweight exercise detection
3. **Enhance SetLogger**: Modify weight entry component
4. **Monitor Progress**: Track implementation via BRANCH_README.md checkboxes

## Technical Architecture Status
- **User Profile System**: ðŸ”„ Enhancement needed for body weight storage
- **Exercise Database**: âœ… Universal exercise database with equipment types ready
- **SetLogger Component**: ðŸ”„ Enhancement needed for bodyweight auto-population
- **Volume Calculations**: âœ… Infrastructure exists, needs bodyweight integration

## Available Commands
- `/init` - AI agent integration setup
- `/branch` - Development branch creation  
- `/task` - Intelligent task execution
- `/sync` - Project state synchronization
- `/web-eval` - Application testing and evaluation
- `/dev` - Start development server
- `/test` - TypeScript validation and testing

## Implementation Timeline (7 Days)
- **Days 1-2**: Foundation - User profile infrastructure & exercise database enhancement
- **Days 3-4**: Core Logic - SetLogger enhancement & additional weight system
- **Days 5-6**: Integration - Volume calculations & missing data handling
- **Day 7**: Polish & Testing - UX refinement & quality assurance

## Foundation Value
This feature establishes the **user profile system** - critical infrastructure enabling:
- Body composition tracking
- Goal-based recommendations  
- Personalized workout analytics
- Progressive overload calculations
- Other features requiring user data

**Branch Focus**: Building sustainable user data collection patterns through bodyweight exercise auto-population
