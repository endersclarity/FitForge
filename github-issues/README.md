# GitHub Issues for FitForge Sophisticated Workflow

This folder contains detailed GitHub issue templates based on the comprehensive user workflow and existing research. These issues bridge the gap between the extensive planning/research already done and the current implementation.

## Issue Priority Breakdown

### High Priority (Core Workflow Blockers)
1. **muscle-activation-heatmap.md** - Visual muscle recovery status
2. **progressive-overload-3percent.md** - Smart progression recommendations  
3. **recovery-tracking-system.md** - 5-day muscle recovery algorithm

### Medium Priority (User Experience Enhancers)
4. **exercise-muscle-filtering.md** - Exercise selection by muscle group
5. **body-weight-auto-population.md** - Auto-populate body weight for bodyweight exercises

## How to Use These Issues

1. **Copy to GitHub**: Each `.md` file can be copied directly into GitHub Issues
2. **Labels Included**: Each issue includes suggested labels for organization
3. **Technical Foundation**: All issues reference existing research and code
4. **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear, testable requirements for each feature

## Research Foundation

These issues are built on top of:
- 60+ research studies analyzed in `docs/EVIDENCE_BASED_PROGRESSION_RESEARCH.md`
- Detailed muscle activation data in `data/exercises/universal-exercise-database.json`
- Progressive overload algorithms in `services/progressive-overload.ts`
- Recovery tracking plans in `docs/PROGRESSION_ALGORITHMS_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

## User Workflow Supported

The complete user journey:
1. Spontaneous workout motivation
2. Exercise selection by muscle group (issue #4)
3. Body weight auto-population (issue #5)  
4. Workout completion with volume tracking
5. 3% progressive overload recommendations (issue #2)
6. Recovery tracking and muscle status (issue #3)
7. Visual recovery heat map (issue #1)

## Next Steps

1. Create these issues in GitHub
2. Prioritize the high-priority issues that block the core workflow
3. Start with the recovery tracking system as it provides the foundation for the heat map
4. Implement progressive overload recommendations for immediate user value
