# Notification Service Handoff

## Background
Agent A previously worked on notification service files that belong in your backend domain:
- server/notificationRoutes.ts
- server/notificationService.ts

## Your Task
These files were created outside the proper boundaries. You need to:

1. Review the existing notification service implementation
2. Take ownership of these backend notification features
3. Integrate them properly into the API structure
4. Enhance and improve the notification system

## Files to Check
- Look for any notification-related files in your server/ directory
- Check if there are any notification routes or services already created
- Build upon any existing work while maintaining proper backend architecture

## Goal
Create a robust notification system as part of the backend API.
