# 🎯 AGENT C - SERVICE INTERFACE STANDARDIZATION TASK

## 📋 CONTEXT REFERENCE
Read PROJECT_CONTEXT.md sections 1-3 for architecture, section 6.3 for your services domain, and section 9 showing your analytics foundation is ready for integration.

## 🚀 INTEGRATION PHASE TASK
Your analytics and AI services are ✅ EXCELLENT! Now standardize interfaces so Agent B's pages and Agent D's API can integrate seamlessly.

### 🎯 SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:
1. **TypeScript Interface Export**: Create consistent interfaces for all your services
2. **Goal Analytics Integration**: Prepare goal progress methods for Agent B's pages
3. **API Contract Definition**: Define data contracts for Agent D's backend integration
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Ensure services perform well under integration load

### 📁 YOUR DOMAIN FOCUS:
- `client/src/services/goal-progress-engine.ts` - Export goal analytics interfaces
- `client/src/services/workout-analytics-service.ts` - Standardize analytics contracts
- `client/src/services/user-preferences-service.ts` - Prepare preferences for Agent D
- All service files - Consistent TypeScript interfaces and error handling

### 🔗 INTEGRATION AWARENESS:
- **Agent B's Pages**: Export `getGoalProgress()`, `calculateGoalTrends()` methods they need
- **Agent D's API**: Provide data contracts for notification preferences and analytics
- **Agent A's UI**: Ensure your services work with mobile-optimized components

### ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Clean TypeScript interfaces exported from all services
- Goal analytics methods ready for Agent B's consumption
- User preference contracts defined for Agent D's notifications
- Consistent error handling and performance across services

### 📝 CONFIRM UNDERSTANDING:
Reply with:
1. Which service methods you're exposing for Agent B's goal pages
2. What data contracts you're providing for Agent D's API
3. How you're ensuring consistent performance across integrations

**Your analytics foundation is solid - now make it seamlessly accessible to the entire team!**
