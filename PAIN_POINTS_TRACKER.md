### üìà RESOLUTION RATE: 40% (1 fully resolved, 1 major progress, critical root cause identified)

## Current Major Issues (FIX THESE FIRST)

### üî• Critical - Session Killers
- [x] **WSL Localhost Doesn't Work** - FIXED: Always use WSL IP (172.22.206.209)
- [x] **Frontend/Backend Coordination** - FIXED: Both running through backend on port 5000
- [x] **No Link Validation** - FIXED: All links tested before presenting
- [x] **Auth Flow Confusion** - FIXED: Use ender@test.com to login
- [ ] **Module/Config Conflicts** - ESM/CommonJS issues, Vite config breaking constantly


## MANDATORY WORKFLOW CHANGES

### Before Presenting ANY Link:
1. ‚úÖ **Test the link yourself** - curl, browser check, actual validation
2. ‚úÖ **Verify all required services are running** - backend, frontend, database
3. ‚úÖ **Check WSL IP accessibility** - Always use WSL IP, never localhost
4. ‚úÖ **Test specific feature being demo'd** - Don't just check homepage

### Development Pipeline:
1. **Start Session** - Check what's running, what needs to be started
2. **Build Feature** - Small, testable chunks
3. **Validate Feature** - Actually test it works before showing user
4. **Present Feature** - Working link + what to expect + how to test
5. **Get Feedback** - User tests, reports issues
6. **Fix Issues** - Before moving to next feature

### Session Continuity:
1. **End Session** - Document exactly what's working, what's broken, next steps
2. **Start Session** - Read previous state, start required services, validate working
3. **Update Tracker** - Mark issues as fixed, add new ones discovered



## CURRENT STATUS: MOSTLY WORKING! üéâ

### What's Actually Working Right Now:
- [x] Frontend loads at http://172.22.206.209:5000 ‚úÖ (verified - shows login page)
- [x] Backend API responds ‚úÖ (verified - 38 exercises, auth endpoints working) 
- [x] Database contains exercise data ‚úÖ (verified - 4 workout types, realistic data)
- [x] Login system works ‚úÖ (verified - use email: ender@test.com)
- [ ] Workout flow works end-to-end ‚ùå (needs user testing)

### Next Session Goals:
1. **Fix current setup** - Get ONE working demo link that actually works
2. **Validate workout flow** - User can select exercises, start workout, log sets
3. **Document exact startup process** - So next session starts immediately

## RULES GOING FORWARD

### For Claude:
- ‚ùå **NEVER** say "it should work" without testing
- ‚ùå **NEVER** give localhost links  
- ‚ùå **NEVER** present features without end-to-end validation
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** test the link before presenting
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** use WSL IP for browser access
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** verify required services are running

### For Sessions:
- ‚úÖ Start every session by checking this file
- ‚úÖ End every session by updating this file
- ‚úÖ Fix at least 1 pain point per session
- ‚úÖ Measure progress: fewer debugging, more building

---

**CURRENT PRIORITY: Get ONE working demo that user can actually access and test.**
