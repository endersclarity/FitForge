# Digital Ocean Deployment Fix

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Removed Replit Development Script**: Cleaned up `client/index.html` to remove development-only script that was causing production issues
2. **Added Production Metadata**: Added proper title and description meta tags for SEO
3. **Maintained Current Configuration**: Kept existing app.yaml configuration that matches project structure

## Changes Made:

### client/index.html
- Removed `https://replit.com/public/js/replit-dev-banner.js` script
- Added `<title>FitForge - Your Personal Fitness Tracker</title>`
- Added description meta tag for SEO

## Expected Results:

After pushing these changes to the master branch:
1. Digital Ocean will automatically trigger a new deployment
2. Build process should complete successfully without Replit script conflicts
3. Production site should load properly with clean HTML

## Next Steps:

1. Commit and push changes to master branch
2. Monitor Digital Ocean deployment logs
3. Test production URL once deployment completes
4. If still blank, check browser console for JavaScript errors
