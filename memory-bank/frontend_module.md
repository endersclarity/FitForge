# Module: Frontend

## Purpose & Responsibility
The Frontend module is responsible for the React-based user interface, providing a responsive and interactive experience for workout tracking, progress monitoring, and community engagement. It manages client-side routing, state management with React Query, theming, and real-time workout session interactions.

## Interfaces
* `App Component`: Main application component with routing and providers
  * `Router`: Handles client-side navigation with Wouter
  * `ProtectedRoute`: Manages authentication-based route access
* `Page Components`: Full-page views for different application sections
  * `Home`: Landing page with hero section and feature overview
  * `Dashboard`: User dashboard with analytics and quick actions
  * `Workouts`: Workout library and management interface
  * `Progress`: Analytics and progress tracking visualization
  * `Profile`: User settings and preferences
* Input: User interactions, API responses, authentication state
* Output: Rendered UI components, API requests, navigation events

## Implementation Details
* Files: 
  - `client/src/App.tsx` - Main application component with routing
  - `client/src/pages/*.tsx` - Page components for different sections
  - `client/src/components/*.tsx` - Feature components (navigation, workout tracking)
  - `client/src/components/ui/*.tsx` - Reusable UI component library
  - `client/src/hooks/*.tsx` - Custom React hooks for state management
  - `client/src/lib/*.ts` - Utility functions and configuration
* Important algorithms: 
  - React Query for server state management
  - Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
  - Framer Motion for animations and transitions
* Data Models
  - `User`: Authentication and profile data
  - `WorkoutSession`: Live workout tracking state
  - `Exercise`: Exercise definitions and parameters

## Current Implementation Status
* Completed: 
  - Component library with Radix UI integration
  - Basic routing and authentication flow
  - UI components and theming system
  - Workout session state management
* In Progress: 
  - Button functionality fixes and event handlers
  - Navigation improvements and route completion
* Pending: 
  - Workout calculation logic integration
  - Real-time progress updates
  - Advanced analytics visualizations

## Implementation Plans & Tasks
* `implementation_plan_button_functionality.md`
  - [Fix Navigation Events]: Add onClick handlers for all navigation buttons
  - [Complete Routing]: Implement missing route configurations
  - [Workout Integration]: Connect workout components to backend APIs
* `implementation_plan_ui_polish.md`
  - [Mobile Responsiveness]: Ensure all components work on mobile devices
  - [Loading States]: Add proper loading indicators for all interactions
  - [Error Handling]: Implement comprehensive error handling and user feedback
