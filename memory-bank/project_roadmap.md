```

## 4. Key Project-Wide Milestones
*   **Infrastructure Complete**: Foundation and database setup - Status: Achieved
*   **MVP Functionality**: Basic workout tracking operational - Status: In Progress (Phase 4)
*   **Beta Release**: Core features with button functionality - Status: Planned (Post Phase 4)
*   **Feature Complete**: All planned features implemented - Status: Planned (Post Phase 3)

## 5. Overall Project Notes / Strategic Considerations
*   Current focus on Phase 4 to transform UI showcase into functional application
*   WSL development environment requires special IP handling for browser testing
*   Interactive Web Debugging Extension being developed in parallel for enhanced development workflow
*   Branch strategy focuses on systematic fixes rather than new feature development
