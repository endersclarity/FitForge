# Task: Strategy_Button_Audit
**Parent:** `implementation_plan_button_functionality.md`
**Children:** None

## Objective
Create a comprehensive inventory of all non-functional buttons throughout the FitForge application, categorize them by priority and complexity, and establish a systematic approach for implementing their functionality.

## Context
FitForge currently has a complete UI with numerous buttons and interactive elements that lack proper event handlers and backend integration. The BRANCH_README.md indicates this is Phase 4 focusing on button functionality fixes. Need to understand the full scope before beginning implementation work.

## Steps
1. **Component Analysis**
   - Scan all React components in `client/src/components/` for button elements
   - Check all page components in `client/src/pages/` for interactive elements
   - Document current onClick handlers (functional vs missing)

2. **Button Categorization**
   - **Navigation Buttons**: Menu items, page transitions, routing
   - **Action Buttons**: Workout operations, data management, user actions  
   - **Form Buttons**: Submit, cancel, save operations
   - **UI Control Buttons**: Toggles, dropdowns, modal triggers

3. **Priority Matrix Creation**
   - **P1 (Critical)**: Core navigation, primary user flows
   - **P2 (Important)**: Workout functionality, dashboard actions
   - **P3 (Enhancement)**: Advanced features, secondary actions

4. **Implementation Complexity Assessment**
   - **Simple**: Basic navigation with router
   - **Medium**: State updates with API calls
   - **Complex**: Multi-step workflows, real-time updates

5. **Documentation Creation**
   - Create detailed inventory with file locations
   - Map buttons to required backend endpoints
   - Identify dependencies between button implementations

## Dependencies
- Requires: Access to complete FitForge component library
- Blocks: All subsequent button implementation tasks

## Expected Output
Comprehensive button audit document with:
- Complete inventory of all buttons by component
- Priority and complexity classifications
- Implementation roadmap with dependencies
- Identification of missing backend endpoints needed
