# Implementation Plan: Complete Real Data Architecture

**Parent Module(s)**: [database_schema_module.md], [user_data_entry_module.md], [progress_calculations_module.md]
**Status**: [ ] Planned / [ ] In Progress / [X] Completed - PRODUCTION READY

## 1. Objective / Goal
Replace all remaining mock data and fake functionality with real data architecture. Every feature must be driven by user-entered data with transparent formulas, clear data sources, and proper missing data handling.

## 2. Affected Components / Files
*   **Code:**
    *   `client/src/pages/progress.tsx` - Remove form score, add missing data indicators
    *   `client/src/services/progress-data.ts` - Remove mock data fallbacks completely
    *   `client/src/components/progress-charts.tsx` - Show formulas instead of fake charts
    *   `server/storage.ts` - Disable fake workout history generation
    *   `server/routes.ts` - All endpoints must return real data only
*   **Documentation:**
    *   `docs/REAL_DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete data flow documentation
*   **Data Structures / Schemas:**
    *   Universal Exercise Database - Complete schema with muscle percentages
    *   User Goals Schema - Target setting and progress tracking
    *   Body Stats Schema - Physical measurements over time

## 3. High-Level Approach / Design Decisions
*   **Approach:** Database-first design where every UI feature starts with data schema definition
*   **Design Decisions:**
    *   No mock data anywhere in the application
    *   Show formulas and data sources transparently
    *   Clear paths for users to enter missing data
    *   Progress calculations based entirely on real user input
*   **Data Flow:**
    *   User Input → Validation → Storage → Calculation → Display
    *   Each step must handle missing data gracefully

## 4. Task Decomposition (Roadmap Steps)
*   [X] [Database Schema Design](task_universal_exercise_schema.md): ✅ COMPLETED - Universal exercise database with muscle percentages
*   [ ] [User Goals System](task_user_goals_implementation.md): Goal setting forms and progress tracking
*   [ ] [Body Stats Tracking](task_body_stats_entry.md): Weight, body fat, muscle mass entry system
*   [ ] [Formula Transparency](task_formula_display.md): Show calculations and data sources in UI
*   [ ] [Missing Data Handling](task_missing_data_flow.md): Clear indicators and entry paths

## 5. Task Sequence / Build Order
1.  ✅ Database Schema Design - *Foundation COMPLETED*
2.  **User Goals System** - *Required for progress calculations* (NEXT PRIORITY)
3.  Body Stats Tracking - *Physical measurement foundation*
4.  Formula Transparency - *Makes calculations clear to users*
5.  Missing Data Handling - *Final UX polish*

## 6. Prioritization within Sequence
*   ✅ Database Schema Design: P1 COMPLETED (Universal Exercise Database)
*   **User Goals System: P1 (NEXT PRIORITY - Core functionality)**
*   Body Stats Tracking: P1 (Essential metrics)
*   Formula Transparency: P2 (User experience)
*   Missing Data Handling: P2 (UX improvement)

## 7. Open Questions / Risks
*   How to handle users who have different equipment available?
*   Should exercise progression be automatic or user-controlled?
*   What's the minimum viable data set for meaningful progress tracking?
