# System: FitForge - Real Data Architecture Fitness Ecosystem

## Purpose
FitForge is a data-driven fitness tracking application that allows users to log real workouts, track progress, and receive AI-powered recommendations based entirely on user-entered data. No mock data - only real user input and calculated metrics.

## Architecture
```
[Frontend Data Entry] <-> [API Routes] <-> [Database Schema] <-> [User Data Files]
         |                      |               |                      |
         |                      |               |                      +-- JSON User Storage
         |                      |               +-- Schema Validation (Zod)
         |                      +-- Real Data Endpoints
         +-- User Input Forms
         +-- Progress Display (Formula-based)
```

## Module Registry
- [Database Schema (`database_schema_module.md`)]: âœ… Universal Exercise Database implemented
- [User Data Entry (`user_data_entry_module.md`)]: Forms and input systems for real data
- [Progress Calculations (`progress_calculations_module.md`)]: Formula-based metrics from real data
- [Universal Exercise Database (`task_universal_exercise_schema.md`)]: âœ… COMPLETED - 38 real exercises with muscle engagement

## Data Architecture Philosophy
1. **User Data Dependency**: Every feature depends on user-entered data
2. **Formula Transparency**: Show calculations and data sources clearly
3. **Real Data Only**: No mock data, no fake fallbacks
4. **Database First**: Design data schema before building UI
5. **Clear Missing Data**: Show what's needed when data doesn't exist

## Development Workflow
1. Design database schema and relationships
2. Build user data entry forms
3. Create API endpoints for real data
4. Implement formula-based calculations
5. Build UI that displays real data or clear formulas
6. Test with real user input scenarios
