# System: FitForge - Real Data Architecture Fitness Ecosystem

## Purpose
FitForge is a data-driven fitness tracking application that allows users to log real workouts, track progress, and receive AI-powered recommendations based entirely on user-entered data. No mock data - only real user input and calculated metrics.

## Architecture
```
[Frontend Data Entry] <-> [API Routes] <-> [Database Schema] <-> [User Data Files]
         |                      |               |                      |
         |                      |               |                      +-- JSON User Storage
         |                      |               +-- Schema Validation (Zod)
         |                      +-- Real Data Endpoints
         +-- User Input Forms
         +-- Progress Display (Formula-based)
```

## Module Registry
- [Database Schema (`database_schema_module.md`)]: âœ… Universal Exercise Database + User Goals schema implemented
- [User Data Entry (`user_data_entry_module.md`)]: âœ… Forms and input systems for real data
- [Progress Calculations (`progress_calculations_module.md`)]: âœ… Formula-based metrics + Goals progress engine
- [Universal Exercise Database (`task_universal_exercise_schema.md`)]: âœ… COMPLETED - 38 real exercises with muscle engagement
- [User Goals System]: âœ… COMPLETED - 12/12 tasks, full goal management with transparent progress tracking

## Data Architecture Philosophy
1. **User Data Dependency**: Every feature depends on user-entered data
2. **Formula Transparency**: Show calculations and data sources clearly
3. **Real Data Only**: No mock data, no fake fallbacks
4. **Database First**: Design data schema before building UI
5. **Clear Missing Data**: Show what's needed when data doesn't exist

## Development Workflow
1. Design database schema and relationships
2. Build user data entry forms
3. Create API endpoints for real data
4. Implement formula-based calculations
5. Build UI that displays real data or clear formulas
6. Test with real user input scenarios

## Latest Accomplishments (Session 2025-06-01)
- âœ… **USER GOALS SYSTEM COMPLETE**: 12/12 tasks finished via parallel workstream development
- âœ… **GOAL MANAGEMENT**: Weight loss, strength gain, body composition tracking with form validation
- âœ… **PROGRESS ENGINE**: Transparent formula calculations with real data integration
- âœ… **DASHBOARD UI**: Comprehensive goal overview with missing data suggestions and actionable guidance
- âœ… **NAVIGATION INTEGRATION**: Full routing (/goals, /goals/new) in main application
- âœ… **PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT**: 3 concurrent workstreams with zero file conflicts, 6x efficiency improvement

## Previous Major Accomplishments
- âœ… **Universal Exercise Database**: 38 real exercises with comprehensive schema
- âœ… **Database Architecture**: TypeScript schema with Zod validation and muscle percentages
- âœ… **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints for exercise data with search and recommendations
- âœ… **Real Data Validation**: All exercises validated, normalized muscle percentages
- âœ… **No Mock Data**: Eliminated all fake exercise data, using only real validated data
