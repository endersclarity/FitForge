# Module: Progressive Overload AI System

## Purpose & Responsibility
The Progressive Overload AI module provides intelligent workout progression recommendations based on user performance analysis and fitness goals. It analyzes historical workout data to suggest optimal weight, rep, and set adjustments following proven progressive overload principles for continuous fitness improvement.

## Interfaces
* `ProgressiveOverloadService`: Core recommendation engine
  * `analyzePerformance(userId, exerciseId, recentSets)`: Analyzes recent performance trends
  * `generateRecommendations(userData, exerciseHistory)`: Creates progression suggestions
  * `updateUserFeedback(userId, recommendationId, feedback)`: Learns from user responses
* Input: User workout history, exercise performance data, user preferences
* Output: Personalized progression recommendations (weight/reps/sets adjustments)

## Implementation Details
* Files:
  * `services/progressive-overload.ts` - Core AI recommendation logic and algorithms
  * `client/src/hooks/use-progressive-overload.tsx` - React integration and state management
  * `client/src/components/workout/ProgressiveOverloadSuggestion.tsx` - UI component for displaying recommendations
  * `services/__tests__/progressive-overload.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite
* Important algorithms:
  * Performance trend analysis using rolling averages and statistical variance
  * Progressive overload calculation based on 1RM estimation and training principles
  * Adaptive recommendation engine that learns from user feedback patterns
* Data Models
    * `ProgressionAnalysis`: Historical performance metrics and trend calculations
    * `OverloadRecommendation`: Suggested progression with confidence scores
    * `UserFeedback`: Recommendation effectiveness tracking for algorithm improvement

## Current Implementation Status
* Completed: 
  * Core progressive overload algorithm with multiple progression strategies
  * Performance analysis engine with statistical trend detection
  * React hook integration for seamless frontend consumption
  * UI component for displaying recommendations in workout sessions
  * Comprehensive test suite with edge case coverage
* In Progress: 
  * User feedback collection and algorithm refinement
  * Advanced progression strategies for different training styles
* Pending: 
  * Machine learning integration for personalized recommendation optimization
  * Integration with wearable device data for real-time form analysis

## Implementation Plans & Tasks
* `implementation_plan_onboarding_system.md`
  * User preference integration for personalized recommendations
  * Goal-based progression strategy selection
* `implementation_plan_real_data_architecture.md`
  * Historical workout data analysis for recommendation accuracy
  * Performance tracking and metrics calculation

## Integration Points
* **Workout Session Module**: Provides recommendations during active workout logging
* **User Preferences Module**: Uses fitness goals and experience level for personalization
* **Progress Analytics Module**: Contributes to long-term progress visualization
* **Real Data Architecture**: Analyzes historical workout data for trend identification
