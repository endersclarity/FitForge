# Implementation Plan: Button Functionality and Navigation Fixes

**Parent Module(s)**: [frontend_module.md], [backend_module.md]
**Status**: [x] Proposed / [x] Planned / [ ] In Progress / [ ] Completed / [ ] Deferred

## 1. Objective / Goal
Transform FitForge from a non-functional UI showcase into a fully operational workout tracking application by systematically implementing button functionality, navigation event handlers, and connecting frontend components to backend business logic.

## 2. Affected Components / Files
*   **Code:**
    *   `client/src/components/navigation.tsx` - Add missing onClick handlers for menu navigation
    *   `client/src/components/hero-section.tsx` - Implement "View Dashboard" and "Browse Workouts" button actions
    *   `client/src/components/workout-starter.tsx` - Connect workout initiation logic
    *   `client/src/components/workout-library.tsx` - Add template selection and navigation functionality
    *   `client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx` - Connect dashboard actions to workout data
    *   `client/src/pages/workouts.tsx` - Implement workout management functionality
    *   `server/routes.ts` - Add missing API endpoints for workout operations
*   **Documentation:**
    *   `BRANCH_README.md` - Track progress against success criteria
    *   `activeContext.md` - Update current implementation status
*   **Data Structures / Schemas:**
    *   Enhanced workout session state management
    *   Button interaction tracking and validation

## 3. High-Level Approach / Design Decisions
*   **Approach:** Systematic audit of all non-functional buttons, priority-based implementation starting with core navigation, then workout-specific functionality
*   **Design Decisions:**
    *   Event Handler Consistency: Use consistent onClick pattern across all interactive elements
    *   Router Integration: Leverage Wouter router for programmatic navigation
    *   State Management: Utilize React Query for server state and custom hooks for local state
*   **Algorithms (if applicable):**
    *   Button Priority Matrix: Categorize buttons by user impact and implementation complexity
    *   Progressive Enhancement: Start with basic navigation, add complex workout logic incrementally
*   **Data Flow (if significant):**
    *   User Interaction → Event Handler → State Update → API Call → UI Feedback

## 4. Task Decomposition (Roadmap Steps)
*   [ ] [Strategy_Button_Audit](memory-bank/task_button_audit.md) (`button_audit`): Comprehensive catalog of all non-functional buttons with priority ranking
*   [ ] [Execution_Navigation_Handlers](memory-bank/task_navigation_handlers.md) (`nav_handlers`): Implement onClick handlers for navigation components
*   [ ] [Execution_Hero_Actions](memory-bank/task_hero_actions.md) (`hero_actions`): Connect hero section buttons to dashboard and workout pages
*   [ ] [Execution_Workout_Integration](memory-bank/task_workout_integration.md) (`workout_integration`): Connect workout components to backend APIs and business logic
*   [ ] [Execution_Dashboard_Connection](memory-bank/task_dashboard_connection.md) (`dashboard_connection`): Implement dashboard action buttons and data connections

## 5. Task Sequence / Build Order
1. Strategy_Button_Audit (`button_audit`) - *Reason: Must understand scope before implementation*
2. Execution_Navigation_Handlers (`nav_handlers`) - *Reason: Foundation for all page navigation*
3. Execution_Hero_Actions (`hero_actions`) - *Reason: Core user entry points to application*
4. Execution_Dashboard_Connection (`dashboard_connection`) - *Reason: Central hub functionality*
5. Execution_Workout_Integration (`workout_integration`) - *Reason: Most complex, requires foundation*

## 6. Prioritization within Sequence
*   Strategy_Button_Audit (`button_audit`): P1 (Critical Path)
*   Execution_Navigation_Handlers (`nav_handlers`): P1 (Critical Path)
*   Execution_Hero_Actions (`hero_actions`): P1 (High User Impact)
*   Execution_Dashboard_Connection (`dashboard_connection`): P2 (Important but can follow basic navigation)
*   Execution_Workout_Integration (`workout_integration`): P2 (Complex but dependent on foundation)

## 7. Open Questions / Risks
*   Backend API readiness: Some workout endpoints may need creation before frontend integration
*   State management complexity: Live workout sessions may require WebSocket integration
*   Mobile responsiveness: Button fixes must maintain mobile-first design principles
*   Performance impact: Adding event handlers and API calls may affect page load times
