# Implementation Plan: User Onboarding & Preference Management System

**Parent Module(s)**: [frontend_module.md], [backend_module.md]
**Status**: [x] Completed

## 1. Objective / Goal
Implement a comprehensive 5-step guided onboarding flow that captures user preferences, fitness goals, and equipment availability to enable personalized workout recommendations and achievement tracking.

## 2. Affected Components / Files
*   **Code:**
    *   `client/src/pages/onboarding.tsx` - 5-step onboarding flow component
    *   `client/src/hooks/use-user-preferences.tsx` - React Query integration for preferences
    *   `server/userPreferencesRoutes.ts` - RESTful API endpoints for user data
    *   `shared/user-profile.ts` - Type-safe Zod schemas for user preferences
    *   `server/fileStorage.ts` - Extended with user preference storage methods
*   **Documentation:**
    *   `docs/prds/guided-fitness-experience-v1.md` - Complete Product Requirements Document
*   **Data Structures / Schemas:**
    *   UserPreferences Schema - Goals, experience level, equipment, frequency
    *   Achievement Schema - Milestone tracking system
    *   WorkoutRecommendation Schema - AI-generated suggestions

## 3. High-Level Approach / Design Decisions
*   **Approach:** Progressive form-based onboarding with immediate preference storage and recommendation generation
*   **Design Decisions:**
    *   React Hook Form + Zod validation for type-safe form handling
    *   JSON file storage with user-specific directories for data persistence
    *   React Query for optimistic updates and caching
    *   Radix UI components for consistent design system integration
*   **Data Flow:**
    *   User completes onboarding → preferences stored → recommendations generated → dashboard redirect

## 4. Task Decomposition (Roadmap Steps)
*   [x] Create user preference type schemas with Zod validation
*   [x] Build 5-step progressive onboarding UI component
*   [x] Implement backend API endpoints for preference management
*   [x] Extend FileStorage class with user preference methods
*   [x] Create React Query hooks for preference state management
*   [x] Integrate achievement system with milestone tracking
*   [x] Add recommendation generation based on user preferences

## 5. Task Sequence / Build Order
1. User preference schemas (`shared/user-profile.ts`) - Foundation for type safety
2. Backend API endpoints (`server/userPreferencesRoutes.ts`) - Data persistence layer
3. Frontend React hooks (`client/src/hooks/use-user-preferences.tsx`) - State management
4. Onboarding UI component (`client/src/pages/onboarding.tsx`) - User interface
5. Integration testing and validation

## 6. Prioritization within Sequence
*   User preference schemas: P1 (Critical Path - enables all other work)
*   Backend API endpoints: P1 (Critical Path - required for data persistence)
*   Frontend React hooks: P1 (Critical Path - required for UI integration)
*   Onboarding UI component: P1 (Primary user-facing feature)
*   Integration testing: P2 (Quality assurance)

## 7. Implementation Results
✅ **Successfully Implemented:** Complete onboarding system with:
- 5-step guided flow (Welcome → Goals → Experience → Equipment → Preferences)
- Type-safe preference management with Zod validation
- RESTful API endpoints for user data persistence
- Achievement tracking system with milestone progression
- Workout recommendation engine based on user preferences
- Seamless integration with existing FitForge architecture

✅ **Quality Delivered:** Production-ready code with full TypeScript coverage, React Query integration, and comprehensive error handling.
