# Module: User Data Entry

## Purpose & Responsibility
Provides comprehensive user input systems for all data that drives FitForge features. This module ensures users can enter body stats, goals, workout preferences, and exercise logs through intuitive forms that validate and store data properly.

## Interfaces
* `BodyStatsEntry`: Forms for physical measurements
  * `recordBodyStats()`: Weight, body fat, muscle mass entry
  * `setEnergyLevel()`: Daily energy tracking (1-10 scale)
* `GoalSetting`: User target and preference definition
  * `setWeightGoals()`: Current and target weight
  * `setWorkoutFrequency()`: Weekly workout targets
  * `setStrengthGoals()`: Exercise-specific targets
* `WorkoutLogging`: Exercise session recording
  * `logExerciseSet()`: Weight, reps, form score, equipment
  * `completeWorkout()`: Session duration, calories, notes
* Input: User form submissions, manual data entry
* Output: Validated data stored in user-specific JSON files

## Implementation Details
* Files: 
  * `client/src/pages/profile.tsx` - Body stats and goals forms
  * `client/src/components/workout/SetLogger.tsx` - Exercise logging
  * `client/src/hooks/use-user-preferences.tsx` - Data validation and storage
* Important algorithms: 
  * Form validation with Zod schemas
  * Progressive disclosure for complex data entry
  * Auto-save and conflict resolution for partial entries
* Data Models
  * `BodyStatsForm`: weight, bodyFat, muscleMass, date, notes
  * `GoalsForm`: targetWeight, weeklyWorkouts, strengthTargets[]
  * `SetLogForm`: exerciseId, weight, reps, equipment, formScore
  * `WorkoutForm`: workoutType, exercises[], duration, intensity

## Current Implementation Status
* Completed: Basic workout session logging, set recording
* In Progress: Form validation and error handling
* Pending: Body stats entry forms, goal setting interface, data conflict resolution

## Implementation Plans & Tasks
* `implementation_plan_comprehensive_user_forms.md`
  * Body stats tracking forms with historical charts
  * Goal setting wizard with progress tracking
  * Workout preference configuration
* `implementation_plan_data_validation_pipeline.md`
  * Zod schema validation for all user inputs
  * Error handling and user feedback
  * Data consistency checks and auto-correction
