# Module: Backend

## Purpose & Responsibility
The Backend module provides the Express.js API server that handles authentication, workout data management, user profiles, and serves as the bridge between the frontend and database. It manages session-based authentication, API routing, and business logic for fitness tracking features.

## Interfaces
* `Express Server`: Main server application with middleware and routing
  * `registerRoutes`: Route configuration and API endpoint setup
  * `Authentication Middleware`: Session management and user verification
* `API Endpoints`: RESTful endpoints for all application features
  * `/api/auth/*`: User authentication and session management
  * `/api/workouts/*`: Workout creation, tracking, and management
  * `/api/exercises/*`: Exercise database and management
  * `/api/progress/*`: Progress tracking and analytics data
* Input: HTTP requests, database queries, user session data
* Output: JSON API responses, authentication tokens, workout calculations

## Implementation Details
* Files:
  - `server/index.ts` - Main server entry point with middleware setup
  - `server/routes.ts` - API route definitions and handlers
  - `server/storage.ts` - Database interaction layer
  - `server/vite.ts` - Development server and static file serving
* Important algorithms:
  - Session-based authentication with passport.js
  - Workout calculation formulas and progression tracking
  - Real-time data synchronization for live sessions
* Data Models
  - `UserProfile`: User account and preference data
  - `WorkoutSession`: Active and completed workout sessions
  - `ExerciseData`: Exercise definitions and user performance data

## Current Implementation Status
* Completed:
  - Express server setup with middleware
  - Basic authentication and session management
  - Database connection and ORM configuration
  - Development environment with Vite integration
* In Progress:
  - API endpoint implementation for workout features
  - Business logic for workout calculations
* Pending:
  - Real-time WebSocket integration for live sessions
  - Advanced analytics endpoints
  - Nutrition tracking API implementation
