## üìã Executive Summary

### Vision Statement
Transform FitForge from a powerful workout logging tool into an intelligent fitness coach that guides users through their entire fitness journey, from first workout to personal records.

### Business Case
FitForge has successfully implemented a robust real data architecture and progressive overload AI system. However, user adoption and engagement opportunities exist in making these powerful features more accessible and guidance-driven. This initiative will increase user retention, workout frequency, and long-term fitness goal achievement.

### Success Hypothesis
By providing intelligent onboarding, personalized workout recommendations, and proactive coaching during workouts, we will increase user engagement by 40% and improve 30-day retention by 25%.
