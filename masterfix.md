## 🚨 Critical Issues (App-Breaking)

### 1. ✅ Start Workout Route Disabled
**Problem**: The `/start-workout` route is commented out in App.tsx, making the core feature completely inaccessible.
**User Impact**: Cannot start any workout session - the main purpose of the app!
**Fix**: Uncomment lines 84-88 in App.tsx
**Status**: 🟢 FIXED - Route now active

### 2. ✅ Start Workout Page Import Commented
**Problem**: The StartWorkout component import is commented out (line 24)
**User Impact**: Even if route is enabled, component won't load
**Fix**: Uncomment line 24 in App.tsx
**Status**: 🟢 FIXED - Import restored

### 3. ✅ Navigation Has Dead Link
**Problem**: Navigation shows "Start Workout" but leads to 404
**User Impact**: Confusing broken navigation
**Fix**: Ensure navigation only shows working routes
**Status**: 🟢 FIXED - Routes now enabled

## 🟠 Major Issues (Feature-Breaking)

**Status**: 🟢 FIXED - Now shows real workout data

### 6. ✅ Dashboard Shows Fake Progress (70%)

**Status**: 🟢 FIXED - Added comprehensive workout history to Progress page with expandable details

## 🟡 Minor Issues (UX Problems)

### 8. ✅ "Watch Demo" Shows Alert
**Problem**: Lazy implementation with browser alert
**User Impact**: Unprofessional, jarring experience
**Fix**: Create proper demo modal or video
**Status**: 🟢 FIXED - Changed to "Explore Workouts" button

### 9. ✅ Empty Achievements Section
**Problem**: Always shows "No achievements yet"
**User Impact**: Demotivating, seems unfinished
**Fix**: Implement basic achievements or hide section
**Status**: 🟢 FIXED - Added dynamic achievement calculation based on workout data

### 10. ✅ No Body Metrics Input
