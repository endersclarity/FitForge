### What Still Needs Work:

4. ❌ Achievements always empty

### User Experience Score: 7/10
**Verdict**: Sarah can now actually use FitForge to track workouts! The app went from completely broken (2/10) to functional (7/10). Core features work, data is real, and the experience is honest about what's implemented.

## Next Priority:
Create exercise database browser so users can explore all 38 exercises outside of workout context.
